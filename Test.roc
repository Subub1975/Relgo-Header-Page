SDLC: software Development Life Cycle—waterfall, Agile and V
1.Requirement Gathering & Analysis:
2.Desigining
3.Coding
4.Testing-STLC
5.Maintainance and Support
Requirement Gathering Analysis: The business Analyst will interact with the client and receive the BRD document from the client and that document will be given to the UI and UX team for Preparing the FSD Document and mock up screen.
Designing Phase: Based on the FSD and BRD, Development lead will Start Designing of Technical design Document  --contains Low level and High Level document and QA will start designing the test cases and test scenarios – what functionality we are going to test and test cases how many ways we can test that functionalities.
Coding:  Development team will start developing the application based on Technical Design Document, Once Development is done Development team will perform unit Testing then they will give that application to the Testers. 
Testing Phase: Once testers Receive the FSD and BRD they will start analyzing the requirement and start designing the test scenarios and test cases. Once Testers receive the build from the Development team then they will start executing the test cases—Analysis , Designing and Execution
Maintaince and Support: once the product is in go live if there is any clarification or any support this team will look into it.
